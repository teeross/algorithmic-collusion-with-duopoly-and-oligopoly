    git: https://github.com/matteocourthoud, https://matteocourthoud.github.io/

Code additions and modifications:
Oligopoly model adjustments in 'init_oligopoly', code adjustments for 'main' and 'qlearning' to be able to plot desired features in both duopoly and oligopoly models

To replicate the results, just run the `main` file, adjusting the underlying 'init' file for duopoly or oligopoly as desired.
